# Dunk Shot
**Dunk Shot** is a clone of the hypercasual game of the same name. The main gameplay is to throw the ball into as many volleyball rings as possible. Additional functions are available:
+ Switching the night mode. In fact, there are two standard themes available in the game: light and dark. They can be switched either in the game settings or on its main screen.
+ The skin shop is accessible both from the main screen and from the game pause. Skins are available for the in-game currency "stars", which with some chance appear above the volleyball rings.
+ With some chance, obstacles may appear. They are located near the rings. It can be either a wall or a circle.
+ When the player is still aiming the ball, his further trajectory is shown. It can react to the outer walls of the screen.
+ With several successful hits in a row, the ball seems to "light up", and bonus points are added to the score.
+ When hitting any object, except for the ring, bonus points are added
